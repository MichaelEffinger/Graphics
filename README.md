To run tests 
making project should make a 
buld/tests/ComputerGraphics_Tests. that currently tests the following
VectorN
Angle
PointN
Matrix
ColorN
VectorH
AffineTransform3
other math Utilities
Random tests do work, but they run thousands of times so I did not include them for manual testing purposes;
