Things to do computer graphics:


1: change the references to function calls, will require a fair bit of refactor
2: Change all #DEBUGs to just asserts to reduce code bloat
3: Once the references are made, copy constructor and move constructor become unnecessary because they become trivial
4: Change all the division by zero handeling and out of bounds erros to just return a zero vector, instead of throwing
5: Merge Vec 2 and Vec 3 into a VecN class with specialization, this will reduce code but also require a fair bit of refactor
6: Maybe turn HVec into a inheritence based subclass of the preconception Vec4
7: In Hvec remove all homogenizations, those shall be done by vulkan
8: once classes have been merged add in a length(), length squared,  normalize/d and distance distance squared functionality, 
 

Ill probably do in order, not sure yet but its good to have down what I need
